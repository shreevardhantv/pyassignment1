Excercise 10.7

Question 12 : Imagine waking up on a deserted railway station, where trains keep ar-
riving and departing, yet no one is present to manage the hustle. As you
wander about the station, a note catches your eye: ”The person who reads
this becomes the master of the station.”
Manage this special railway station, ensuring trains operate smoothly and
efficiently. Determine whether each approaching train will halt or pass
through, assigning platforms to those that stop. If all platforms are occu-
pied, prioritize, departing the oldest train to accommodate the newcomer.
For trains passing through, an empty platform must be available; if not,
the oldest train must depart to clear the way.
Create a menu-driven program that allows you to input the number of
platforms (n). Simulate the arrival of trains, deciding whether they will
halt or pass through. Assign platforms to halting trains, ensuring efficient
management of the station. At the end of the simulation, display the total
number of trains that have stopped or passed through the station.
